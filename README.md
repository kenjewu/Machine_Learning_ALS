# Machine Learning Algorithm From Scratch
## Introduction
This repository is intended to be used to store the implementation of algorithms that are commonly used in machine learning. These algorithms are implemented from scratch using python and numpy, and drawing is done using matplotlib. Sometimes may also use some other third-party libraries for data processing, such as pandas, etc.

The implementation of these algorithms is mainly to deepen the understanding of machine learning. The structure and execution efficiency of the code may not be the best. Each algorithm's implementation code has two format(md, ipynb) of the text.

## Afterword
The code will continue to be updated to fix the deficiency. If you have a better way of writing or have found my mistake, please let me know.
